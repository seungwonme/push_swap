# Push_swap

The `Push_swap` project is part of the 42 school curriculum, challenging students to create an algorithm that efficiently sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of instructions. The project includes a bonus section with a checker to verify proper sorting and a visualization of the sorting process.

## Overview
The project consists of two main parts:

### Push_swap
The main `push_swap` program implements the sorting algorithm for a stack of integers using a specified set of instructions. The goal is to minimize the number of moves to sort the stack.

### Checker
The `checker` program, located in the `bonus` folder, validates whether the stack is correctly sorted after executing a series of commands generated by push_swap.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seungwonme/push_swap
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd push_swap
```

3. Compile the push_swap and optionally the checker executable:
```bash
make
```

4.  To compile the bonus checker:
```bash
make bonus
```

5. Run the push_swap program with a list of integers:
```bash
./push_swap 5 2 1 4 3
```

- Check if the stack is sorted using the checker program:
```bash
ARG="5 2 1 4 3"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

- To clean up object files:
```bash
make clean
```

- To delete all build files:
```bash
make fclean
```

- To clean and rebuild the executables:
```bash
make re
```
